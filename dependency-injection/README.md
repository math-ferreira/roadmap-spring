# Spring Core - Dependency Injection

Spring Boot uses the Spring Frameworkâ€™s Inversion of Control (IoC) container
to manage objects and their dependencies. The IoC container is responsible for
creating objects, wiring them together, and managing their lifecycle.
When an object is created, its dependencies are also created and injected into the object.
