# Spring Core - Configuration

Spring Core Configuration is the process of configuring the Spring Framework,
which involves specifying the various configuration details required for an application
to function properly. This can include setting up beans, specifying bean dependencies,
configuring aspect-oriented programming (AOP) aspects, and more.
Configuration can be done through Java code, XML files, or using annotations
in the code.
